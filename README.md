# xml-nfe_to_specific_csv_converter
This is my first project :)

This project offers a free xml_nfe to loggi-csv converter. The user shall add either a single or mutliple xml_nfe files (validated by SEFAZ) to the folder xml_folder.

The result csv file will appear in the csv_folder.

xml_to_csvloggi_converter_nfe_key.py sets the nfe_key value as both tracking_key and barcode.

xml_to_csvloggi_converter.py sets a special and complex concatenation as both tracking_key and barcode.
